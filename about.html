     <p> Before we started making our page for the obligatory assignment, we read the task description together. 
         Then we discussed and took notes regarding different tags we could use to fit the criteria for what the page should contain.
         The first decision we made was to have a menu on the top of every page to navigate between the four pages. 
     </p>
     <p> Both the homepage and the portifoliopage is structred into three different sections. 
        The homepage consists of a breif but presice introduction of Jennifer, a section that tells the reader more about her and at the bottom of the page you can fand a list of her hobbies.
        In the introduction we used the <strong>strong</strong> tag to emphasize the fact that Jennifer is an architect so that it stands out on the page when people enter it. 
        We then used the <em>em</em> tag on the word my in the sentence <q>this is <em>my</em> story</q>“ to put some more weight on that exact word. 
        We decided that this was nice to include this because we felt like it was a suiting way to introduce Jennifer and to let people know that this is a page about her. 
       </p>
     <p>
         In the section that tells her story we used the cite tag to cite the book <cite>Aesthetics of Modern Architecture</cite> and the quote tag to quote the motto <q>Less is more</q>.
         In the third section of the homepage, we added a list of Jennifer’s hobbies. 
         It wasn’t natural for us to put in an ordered list here, so we decided to go with an unordered one.
     </p>
     <p> In the portfolio-page we used boxes that we designed in CSS to separate the three projects that we had to include in that page.
         We decided that this was the best option because it makes it more clear for the reader that this is three different projects. 
         We titled each project and we even added a sentence or in the thrid project a word that describes what the paragraph is about even more.
         The reason that we did this was that we liked the look of it, and we felt like the paragraph would seem a bit more interesting for the reader. 
     </p>
     
     <p> The last thing we wanted to include in our website was a footer. 
         We decided to add a footer simply because we thought it was a suitable place to add contact information and some quick links to the social media that we thought were the most relevant. 
         We used the address tag to fill inn her phone number, address, and email.
