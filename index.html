         <p>I am Jennifer Snow and <b>I am an architect.</b> <br/> I have always been facinated by buildings, their history and their design. <br/> A building is so much more than just a composition of materials; it is a story. <br/>Here is <em>my</em> story.</p>

            <h2>A little bit more about me</h2>
            <p>My name is Jennifer Snow, I am 28 years old and born and raised in Oslo. My love for drawing and designing, as well as my passion for numbers, started already in the 1<sup>th</sup> grade. <br/>
                Growing up, I thought; <br/> <b> why not combine the two?</b></p>
            <p> From here, my dream of being an architect came to life. I would say I am inspired by the modernistic and minimalistic architecture.
            In <cite>Aesthetics of Modern Architecture</cite> it is written about the motto of architect Ludwig Mies van der Rohe; <q cite=https://www.hrpub.org/download/20200229/CEA4-14814597.pdf>Less is more</q>. <br/> I agree with that, and this motto is something I keep in the back of my head when I am working.  </p>
        <p>Being able to work with what I love is a blessing. In this portfolio you will get to know me, my resume and my work a little bit better. </p>
