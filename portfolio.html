        <h2>Project 1</h2>
        <p>This project was a new house in Oslo. I created a universaly designed
            house and had it built for the customer. This high end project cost approxematly 10 million and was completed over a
            timeframe of two years. This project included a huge pool, 10 bedromms and grass lawn in the garden.

        <h2>Project 2</h2>
        <p>This project was an apartment renovation in Trondheim. 
            Sinato studio architects under Chikara Onoâ€™s command carried out the renovation of an apartment of 
            64 square meters (690 square feet) in the 26-year-old residential complex in Yokohama City, Japan. 
            Designers decided to arrange the space in such a way so that different zones smoothly flow one into 
            another creating a single living area instead of a single block where the main living functions would 
            be concentrated. In their opinion, this approach will provide the residents with maximum of freedom in 
            the limited space. So, the main part of the apartment is an open L-shaped area with two south-western windows 
            which fill with light and fresh air the entire house.
