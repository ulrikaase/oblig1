        <p>Technology and society (with external links): 
            Write – or re-use a short text you have previously written – (anywhere 
            from 300 to 1000 words) about technology and society. You are allowed 
            to reuse text from "DATA1100 Technology and Society for Programmers" 
            or other subjects. This text should have multiple links to external sites 
            with relevant information. We shall not grade you on how relevant the 
            information you link to is, but we expect several links and we expect it to 
            be easy to understand before clicking what information you lead us to. </p>
     
     <p> Before we started making our page for the obligatory assignment, we read the description for the task together as a group. 
         Then we discussed and took notes regarding different tags we could use to fit the criteria for what the page should contain.
         The first decision we made was to have a menu on the top of every page to navigate between the four pages. 
     </p>
     <p> Both the homepage and the portfolio page is structured into three different sections. 
        The homepage consists of a brief but precise introduction of Jennifer, a section that tells the reader more about her and at the bottom of the page you can fand a list of her hobbies.
        In the introduction we used the <strong>strong</strong> tag to emphasize the fact that Jennifer is an architect so that it stands out on the page when people enter it. 
        We then used the <em>em</em> tag on the word "my" in the sentence <q>this is <em>my</em> story</q> to add some more weight to that exact word. 
        We decided that it was nice to include this because we felt like it was a suiting way to introduce our persona Jennifer, and to let people know that this is a page about her. 
       </p>
     <p>
         In the section that tells her story we used the cite tag to cite the book <cite>Aesthetics of Modern Architecture</cite> and the quote tag to quote the motto <q>Less is more</q>.
         In the third section of the homepage, we added a list of Jennifer’s hobbies. 
         It wasn’t natural for us to put in an ordered list here, so we decided to go with an unordered one.
     </p>
     <p> In the portfolio-page we used boxes that we designed in CSS to separate the three projects that we had to include in that page.
         We decided that this was the best option because it makes it more clear for the reader that this is three different projects. 
         We titled each project, and we added a span tag on the describing part of each project in order to further clarify the content.
         The reason that we did this was that we liked the look of it, and we felt like the paragraph would seem a bit more interesting for the reader. 
     </p>
     
     <p> The last thing we wanted to include in our website was a footer. 
         We decided to add a footer simply because we thought it was a suitable place to add contact information and some quick links to the social media that we thought were the most relevant. 
         We used the address tag to fill inn her phone number, address, and email.
